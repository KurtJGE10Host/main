                        The DOTA 2 tournament was held in Ground Zero at 5:30PM on October 19 2024 and was organized by Esports Negrense League
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        When I heard that there was a Dota 2 Tournament held in Dumaguete I was excited, 
                        personally I have never played Dota 2 since I wasn’t into MOBA’s but it was still fun even though I had no idea how the game works 
                        it was still fun to watch people compete with each other while screaming and hurling insults at each other, 
                        It was what Esports is and it was very enjoyable.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        I’ve only seen Esports tournaments online and it makes me wish we hosted a lot more major Esports tournaments over here like League of 
                        Legend’s Worlds or some CS2 tournament.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Because of the Dota 2 Tournament it made me watch more and more online Esports tournament and made me wish we had more Esports tournaments 
                        over here.

                        The Fun Run was held at Pantawan at 5:30AM on October 27 2024 and was organized by Rotary Club
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The Fun Run started very early in the morning and by the time I got to pantawan they were about to start, 
                        I only spectated but there was a lot more people than I expected especially since it was both raining and it started very early, 
                        it gave me hope because of the fact so many people showed up for a good cause.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        It made me realize that Dumaguete is a very different place compared to my hometown if something like this happened in my hometown only a 
                        fraction of people would show up compared to the amount that turned up here.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Because of this event it made me realize a lot of people in Dumaguete especially love Fun-runs since so many show up everytime there is one, 
                        and because of this event I’m considering to participate in a fun-run

                    <p>
                        The Triathlon was held at Pantawan at 6:00AM on November 10 2024 and was organized by the City of Dumaguete.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        It was my very first time viewing a Triathlon and I was very impressed with the athletes considering of what they had to do they had to Run, 
                        Cycle and then Swim and even though it wasn’t technically a competition it was still something to be competitive about, 
                        what I was most surprised about was the amount of people who decided to participate it seems a lot of people in Dumaguete are very health conscious and decided to participate another 
                        thing I was surprised about is people who participated who don’t necessarily look like athletes still did and completed which was inspiring to say the least.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        It made me think after seeing the amount of people who participated and the amount of people who wasn’t necessarily athletes that competed that maybe I should start participating in activities
                        such as this I might not complete and set any records but it could be beneficial to me especially since 
                        I spend most of my time huddled in my room infront of a computer for 12 hours straight.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Because of this Triathlon I am more aware that I don’t need to be an athlete or have a fit body in order to participate and even compete in things such as this and that I 
                        should start taking care of my body more.

                        This Event was held at the Ravello Field at 3:00PM on November 13 2024 and was organized by the Animal Sanctuary.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        I never knew Dodgeball was even a sport in the Philippines everytime I’ve seen or heard of dodgeball it was in America in TV shows and whatnot and the fact the event was held in order to raise
                        money for the Animal Sanctuary made me want to watch it anyway, 
                        It was a very entertaining fundraising event considering I got to see my fellow students get pelted In the face with balls in the name of animals.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        It made me realize that we are lucky to have our pets but when we look for new ones we shouldn’t buy them or look for specific breeds what we should do is adopt them 
                        from sanctuaries to allow them to live a happy life.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        This event made me realize that as humans we have dominated the planet and have everything nearly under control and being at the top we should be responsible for the other animals 
                        trying to survive on our planet.

                        The tournament was held at Freedom Park on December 1 2024 at 3:00PM and was Organized by the Dumaguete Pickleball Club
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        I’m going to be honest I have never heard of pickle ball before this event but from what I saw it was very similar to tennis but either way the event was fun and 
                        I got to learn a new sport I was surprised that there was a dedicated club about here in Dumaguete.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        I can see the benefits of playing pickleball from what I’ve seen it’s a less intense version of tennis but it is fun and works all your body.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Because of this event I am now aware that dumaugete is home to a lot of people with niche interests.
