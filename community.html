                    <p>Reflection:</p>
                    <p>
                        The Clean-up Drive was held at The Silliman Beach at 6:00AM on November 16 2024 and was organized by BANSEA, 
                        I was a committee member so was my other classmates.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        This was my very first time going to Silliman Beach and I see now why other photographers really loved to take photos there, 
                        especially since there was an airport nearby allowing for great airplane spotting, but that’s now what this is about we went to 
                        Silliman beach in order to Clean-up and when we got there It was already nearly spotless, we still managed to get some plastics and other trash but most of our bags 
                        was filled with sand trapped in said plastics but we still managed to fill several bags but 
                        Silliman beach wasn’t as littered as other beaches I went to.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        I certainly want to go back there for the views but also to clean up especially since it was actually very relaxing hearing the waves crash while
                        doing repetition while also chatting with my classmates, It was very fun.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Because of the Clean-up drive I want to visit Silliman beach more and maybe even start cleaning up the beaches in siquijhor where my family was originally from.

                    <p>
                        The Outreach was held in Silliman Church for the janitors of the school at 4:00PM on November 27 2024
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        I decided to participate in the Christmas outreach for one of the PEP Classes even though I finished PEP last year I still decided to donate some canned goods purely because I had some extra, 
                        I was a little surprised by the sheer amount of Janitors and Cleaners that was employed by Silliman but 
                        I guess when you have a campus as massive as Silliman you need a lot of staff, but the outreach was fun it’s a shame that all we could give to the Janitors was 
                        canned goods the people who keep Silliman clean deserve so much more.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        It also made me realize that we need to be a lot more considerate about our trash and the people who’s job it is to clean it.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Because of this Christmas outreach I am more inclined to keep my trash and throw it at home even if its very small in order to help our 
                        janitors and cleaners even in the smallest of ways.

                    <p>Reflection:</p>
                    <p>
                        The Fair was held on November 28 2024 in the Ravello Field
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        When I arrived  at the Advocacy Fair there was a woman on stage reading something on a phone, 
                        I was a little late so I don’t know if it was her story or someone else’s but her experiences was harrowing to listen to, 
                        it was about how she was abused by her husband and that she felt trapped because he was manipulating her into staying and this made me realize 
                        that even in the modern world women experience violence simply because they are women which baffles me that even 21st century people still treat 
                        women like it’s the 1800s.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        It shocks me that violence against women is still prevalent in these times and that people still get away with it, 
                        I’m glad women like her can now speak up and say something instead of just taking it, It really makes me wonder why the rule of law is so inaffective in 
                        cases like this, but with more women like her speaking up I’m sure change will happen soon.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Because of this event I am now glad about protests about anything are happening instead of seeing them as minor annoyances, 
                        I’m thankful that people are speaking up to make change happen.

                    <p>Reflection:</p>
                    <p>
                        The Sto. Niño Orphanage White Gift making was held on December 14 2024 on 12:00PM at the ATA Hall and was organized by ma'am Dy
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The Sto. Niño Orphanage White Gift was the last activity we had to do for our GE10 class and all we had to do was get things to gift to orphans for christmas.
                        Each group member had to give 1 of each item [sanitary napkin, shampoo, soap, sardines, adult diapers, toothpaste, noodles, canned goods, milk, Milo] to make the process easier we had 
                        a group member buy 10 of each item for our group and we would just divide the cost and pay them what we owe. after which we packed them into boxes and place them in a bigger box
                        which we wrapped with newspaper in order to make it look nicer and make it look more like a present, we then collectively wrote in a christmas card messages and cheers for the orphans.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        I honestly wish we were the ones to give the gifts to the orphans ourselves but because of time constraints we weren't able to, i just hope the orphans will make good use of the gifts we 
                        gave them. This entire thing made me realize that we take our Parents for granted and only when their gone will I realize how important they were in my life, I am very glad to have had 
                        parents who were able to support me and provide me a comfortable life which i cannot say the same for these orphans.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Because of these gift giving I am not gonna take my Parents for granted I should cherish all the time i spend with them wether that be bad or good.
