                    <p>This Event took place on August 19 at 2:00PM at the ATA Hall organized by the Confederates Student Council.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        During the Founders week there were a-lot of activities planned and one of them was the Miller Web Dev Lecture or is it a Seminar? 
                        Either was it was a seminar where a formal Sillimanian graduate of Computer Studies spoke and talked about Web Development and how to keep up with the latest trends and how to build around that. 
                        During the event I was part of the Documentation Committee and it was the first event that I covered.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        During the session I was reassured of my choice of shifting to a course in Computer Studies as 
                        I was already unsure about my future having my first choice of becoming an engineering being shot down within the first year. But after seeing most of the presenters in events like this being former CCS Students allowed me to say to myself that I can just end up like them.

                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Because of the event reassured my choice that shifting to a course in Computer Studies was a good idea and also allowed me to experience my first time being part of a Documentation Committee giving my valuable experience in my future hobby of photography.

                    <p>
                        This GDA took place on August 19 2024 at 10:00AM at the ATA Hall and was organized by the  Guidance  Council, I was part of the Documentation Committee.

                    <p>
                        This was my first experience meeting my fellow CCS Students It was so nice to see that there were many of us a lot of them from different backgrounds and some of them have become friends like a 
                        man named  Philip he was the biggest guy and I forgot how but we eventually became friends as we found out that we were classmates, 
                        overall the event allowed us to get to know each other and develop a connection and bond with each other.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The GDA allowed me to see the fresh new faces I would be seeing as I start a new chapter in my life as a CCS student as I have already noticed that I have not even seen my former classmates from my Engineering days and unlike there 
                        I became really close friends with the people I met.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Because of the GDA I met new friends and new faces that I will be seeing for the rest of my time in CCS.

                    <p>
                        The Lecture was held on August 20 2024 at 8:30AM at the ATA Hall, I was part of the Documentation Committee and was organized by the Student Council.

                    <br>
                    <p> 
                        The event was eye opening just like the Miller Web Dev lecture as It reassured my choice in enrolling in CCS, and similarly to Miller Web Dev the guest speaker was a former CCS Student and 
                        this time he talked about what it was like to work in a big data company that handles as you can guess large amounts of data, 
                        he talked about an experience where he was tasked with making a program that allowed the automatic turning on and off of the lights in a corporate building using sensors and such and that 
                        sounded very complicated and technical that I forgot most about it except for the part he said it was very difficult and demanding purely because of the amount of data that had to be 
                        processed because of the large amount of people that would set off the sensors.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The event really opening my eyes to what it would be like to work in a large data company and even though they probably pay you handsomely I would not want that as a job, 
                        and made me realize that the things we take for granted everyday such as online banking or even browsing our phones use so much data that I feel bad for the people who has to make these work 
                        flawlessly or there will be consequences and BIG consequences for anyone working with financials.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Because of the event I am more aware of the requirement of needing a large workforce to even open a website that handles even a tiny amount of traffic, 
                        it made me realize that so much of our modern infrastructure would fail if there was one error in a code somewhere

                    <p>
                        The Orientation was held on September 11 2024 at 2:00PM at the LUCE Auditorium and was organized by the University Itself.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        This was not my first time attending a University Orientation as I already attended one during my freshman year as an engineering student and as always I was very intrigued that every enrolled student in 
                        Silliman was Insured by the university and honestly even though my parents are the one paying for my tuition here that is still a really good deal and also a good practice for the university, 
                        it made me remember just how lucky I am to be a Silliman Student.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The orientation always made me feel a bit of imposter syndrome as I always told myself that “do I really belong in this university? Do I really deserve a spot here?” 
                        its weird knowing that so many people my age could only dream of going to a university like this and I am very grateful to my parents for willing and supporting my academic endeavors here.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Because of the orientation I am more aware of the inner workings of Silliman and the benefits they give to students like me.

                        This SUCCESS was near the end of my time as an SUCC Macro and what an experience it was, If you didn’t know the SUCCESS is what the elder members of SUCC 
                        [Silliman University Camera Club] would make us Macros [aspiring members/newbies] do every week. Every week we were given a prompt like “long exposure” or any kind of type of photography and 
                        we were given until the next SUCCESS to take photos and submit it and during the SUCCESS there would a guest speaker, usually a former member of the SUCC or a well-known photographer in 
                        Dumaguete City we were even given a lecture by a photographer who documented wars before social media was a thing [I know I should know his name but it was earlier in my time as a Macro] 
                        but after the lecture which is mostly on photography skills we would have to present our photos in front of the elders and explain our methods, our ideas and so fourth and the best photos of 
                        the week would be uploaded to the SUCC page and would increase you chances of becoming a full-time member of SUCC [you can check out my submissions through my Facebook ‘Kurt Jumawan’].
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        My time as an SUCC Macro has really changed me a lot I have always loved taking photos but its usually with my phone camera and whenever I do get my hands on a camera it is always In auto, 
                        but my time with SUCC taught me how to use my camera and develop my skills for my hobby that is photography, and even though I was not selected to become a full time member of SUCC 
                        I still loved and will cherish my experience with them because it allowed me to make new friends and made me love photography even more.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Because of this SUCCESS and my time as an SUCC Macro I see the world with the thought “how would I capture this moment”, 
                        I learned so many valuable lessons and skills during my time and it really would allow me to pursue my hobby of photography to the next level.
