                    <p>
                        The Acquaintance Party was held on September 28 2024 at 5:00PM at the Silliman Elementary Grounds and was organized by the Confederates 
                        Student Council, I was part of the Documentation Committee.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        This was not my first Acquaintance Party as a student in Silliman, 
                        my first acquaintance party was when I was in College of Engineering and Design and at the end we the seniors threw flour at us as initiation, 
                        to say the least I was prepared to run if the same thing happened to me at the CCS Party but I was pleasantly surprised. 
                        The theme of the Party was “Mafia” theme everyone was dressed in the best and formal outfits while I realized last minute my suit pants had a 
                        hole in it and was held together by a safety pin, but other than that the Event was fun and the food was way better than I expected.

                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The Party allowed me to make closer connections with my classmates and new found friends in CCS, 
                        I even discovered that my friend Leahanna was an incredibly good singer and performer.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Because of the Party I was able to become closer to my classmates and friends and I became more acquainted with the students of CCS

                        The Parade was held at 6:00PM on August 30 2024 and was organized by Silliman University.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        This was my first time seeing the Parade of Lights as I missed my chance during my freshman year in CED, 
                        It was very cool seeing all the different departments made for the Parade and the CED’s parade especially, 
                        I was kind of sad that I couldn’t join my former CED Classmates during the parade because well I decided to shift to BSIT but 
                        I do not regret it as whenever I spoke with them they were miserable because of thermodynamics knowing me I wouldn’t even be able to handle it.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The parade was very fun and ended with at the Ravello field where there was an entire festival set up with food stalls and everything but 
                        I couldn’t find anything I wanted to eat 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Because of this Event I was able to see the Parade of Lights for the first and the Hibalag Festival.

                        The Campus Tour happened on September 18 2024 at 1:00PM and was organized by Ma’am Dy herself.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The Campus Tour happened because it was an activity ma’am Dy gave us but it was very enjoyable, 
                        I never had a tour during my freshmen year here in Silliman and it was eye opening knowing the stories and history of the different buildings on 
                        Campus, I even discovered parts of the Campus I’ve never seen before and even parts I didn’t know was accessible to students. 
                        And I found out about the time capsules buried under benches which I never even knew about.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The Tour allowed me to learn more  about Silliman University and its rich history from humble beginnings to its meteoric rise as one of the top universities in the 
                        Philippines.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Because of this Tour I am more aware of the rich history of Silliman and its unique stories on campus from its involvement in the war to its time capsules buried by every graduating class.

                        The SUCC Photowalk happened on October 6 2024 at 1:00PM and was organized by SUCC.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The SUCC Photowalk happened because our guest speaker for that weeks SUCC SUCCESS was Denniz Futulan a well known Photographer in Dumaguete, 
                        he spoke about how knowing how to interact with people is an essential skill in photography as you are often Photographing people and such, 
                        so in order to help us learn he made us have a photowalk to take photos and talk to locals and passersby in order to teach us this skill.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        When I started as an SUCC Macro I was very shy especially when it came to photographing people, it was fine during events as people are expecting to be photographed but during day to day life it might come off as creepy or weird to take random pictures of people, 
                        he taught us how to talk to people and ask for their permission and allowed me to be a lot more confident in photography of random people.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Because of this Photowalk I am now able to interact with people In order to photograph them without coming off as creepy or weird.

                        The Music Festival was held at Pantawan People’s Park on November 24 2024 at 8:00PM and was organized by the City of Dumaguete
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        This was my first time attending a Music Festival and it met all my expectations, 
                        there was a large crowd because of the fact that there was no ticket or fee it was just open to the public and even though it was held on a rainy night there was no stopping the crowd because of the performer 
                        “TJ” even in pouring rain nobody went home until he did his performance.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        It being my first Music Festival made me want to attend more music festivals in the future as they are so much fun even though by the end we were dropping wet from the rain, 
                        I would like to go to more music festivals in the future.

                    <p>
                        Because of the Music Festival I am more inclined to attend more music festivals in the future as it was more fun than I thought.

                    <p>Reflection:</p>
                    <p>
                        The parade was held on August 26 2024 at 1:00PM organized by Silliman University, this was the first event I covered as an SUCC Macro.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Parada Sillimania was a parade that showcased each and every college department even down to individual clubs and organizations within the University, 
                        it is also the very first event we SUCC Macros covered and it was an amazing opportunity to show our elders our current level of skills so that they can figure out what we can improve on and such, 
                        during the parade we were stationed at different points along the route of the parade we were lucky enough to be stationed at the 7/11 in front of the SUMC so when the parade still hasn’t arrived 
                        we would just chill.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Because of the parades various different floats and etc it pushed our current knowledge and skills on photography to the limit, with the changing lighting, colors and so on there was so much to take into account and I see now why professional photographers charge so much. 
                        A good camera can take you a long ways but skills are what you rely upon and even with a bad or old camera if you have the skills you can take photos with an old camera that are 100 times better than a new camera. It really opened my eyes to the difficulty of photography and just how much skill is needed to improve and be better at it.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Because of the parade I am much more aware of how difficult photography actually is and just how much skill is required to take good photos and how ever changing landscapes and other variables can impact a photo so much that you constantly need to change settings and such. 
                        The parade really opened my eyes to how difficult photography is.
