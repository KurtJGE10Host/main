                    <p>Reflection:</p>
                    <p>
                        This opening devotion was held inside the Silliman church at 8:00AM during the start of the school year, 
                        I was part of the documentation committee taking pictures of the mass.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>    
                        This was not my first opening devotion because it is not my first year in Silliman, 
                        I am originally a shiftee from the College of Engineering after failing this summer term putting me behind by a year 
                        I decided to get a fresh start and shifted to the college of computer studies as a IT student, during the mass 
                        I learned several new skills about photography because of the fact I was part of the documentation committee.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>   
                        I’m not really a religious person as I barely go to church and attend masses but this put me at ease but this marked my first event as a 
                        CCS student and also marks the start of a new chapter in my life after shifting from CED.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>    
                        Because of this convocation I can now call myself a CCS student as this solidified my place In CCS with a blessing.

                    <p>
                        The Sunday mass was held at the cathedral 10:00AM on October 13 2024.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        I am not really a religious person, but every Sunday I go to church, not to attend mass but to light a candle and pray, 
                        I personally believe that is a better way of showing your faith in the lord attending mass but this Sunday 
                        I decided to attend mass not only because it would be an entry into the journal but also because I haven’t attended mass ever since I went to 
                        college, whenever I go mass I usually go with my family but since I am far away from them this is the first time I went to mass on my own.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Going to mass alone made me feel sad but also glad that I am now independent and I am not forced to go to mass every Sunday, 
                        but I do feel a little bit of melancholy because even though Sundays in my family is reserved for masses we usually go eat at a 
                        fancy restaurant afterwards for family time, It made me realize that I miss my family much more than I thought.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Because of this mass I am more aware of how important it is even as a bonding event for families.

                    <p>
                        This Convocation was on October 14 2024 at 9:00AM and was held in the Luce auditorium
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        This Convocation was my first one that’s because during my freshmen year as a CED student 
                        
                        I may or may not have forgot about it and missed the event so this was my first time actually attending a convocation during the 
                        Founders Week in Silliman, and as always I am stunned by Luce auditorium I’ve never been in a theater like it, 
                        we barely had anything like this in my home city and reminds me that I am very lucky to be studying at Silliman University.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        This Convocation was a new experience to me since I missed my first convocation during my time in CED, 
                        so it really made me feel like a freshmen again with new people to become friends and acquaintances with, 
                        and in the final parts of the Convocation the band started playing the Stars Theme which in a room full of nerds and geeks 
                        like myself was an awesome treat.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Because of this Convocation I am reminded that I am very lucky to have been accepted into Silliman 
                        and to have a family who supports me in my academics even when I fail and flop.

                    <p>
                        This Service was held in the Silliman Church at 6:30PM on October 30 2024
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        I went to this Midweek Service because of two things, entries for this journal and to put myself at ease for the upcoming Midterms, 
                        Its one of the few times I go to mass willingly but I was really stressed out about projects and as mentioned the Midterms,
                         I’m not a religious person but I do believe in God and even when I don’t just going to church puts me at ease because whenever I do 
                         pray everything always works out in the end.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        This made me realize that the reason why a lot of people still go to church in our modern world is because of faith, 
                        faith that everything will work out even I feel the effects of just having faith in something even when we have no proof of knowledge on anything.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Because of this Midweek Service I finally understood what people meant by “Just have a little faith in something”.

                        I was documenting this event as an SUCC Macro, you can find my photos on the SUCC page with a watermark bearing my name on the bottom right. 
                        This event allowed me to use my skills that I learned during my time as an SUCC Maro and even though in the end I wasn’t accepted it was still 
                        a helpful for my hobby that is photography, on the other hand seeing all these medical school students reminded me that was are the future of 
                        not just our country but our society, that these people I am seeing infront of me are someday going to be doctors, nurses, pharmacists helping 
                        others. With my mother being a retired nurse I have huge respect for people who work in the medical field to help people.

                        for the next generation even if we only improve it by a little.

                        This Midweek Convocation was held at the Silliman Church 6:00PM on November 20 2024.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        This convocation was held at night and in the rain and still a lot of us turned up wet and damp, 
                        because of this event was held nearing the end of November it was probably gonna be the last church event 
                        I will attend for the semester as it was nearing December and the end of the semester and I was missing only 
                        1 even for my church so this was perfect, but this reminded me of how fast time goes by one minute we were just starting and the next we were 
                        already nearing the end of our semester, everyone in the church had differing experiences growing each one of us, speaking for myself I had a 
                        massive life affecting change in just this year, I changed my course completely changing the trajectory of my life.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        It occurred to me that college is such a small part of our lives but in the end it has one of the biggest impacts to where you are headed in life, 
                        and that I should take it more seriously.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Because of this convocation I am more informed that my choices and actions during my time in college no matter how small may have large consequences.
